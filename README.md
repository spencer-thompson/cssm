# Crafting Secure System Messages

This is the Github Repo for the paper I wrote **Crafting Secure System Messages**

## Replicate my findings:

Run the following commands to setup a virtual environment, install the requirements. Make sure to create an `env.py` file with `openai_key = '...'`

1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `.venv/Scripts/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python sys_msg.py`

Fair warning this uses just over 100k tokens, and will cost a couple dollars.
